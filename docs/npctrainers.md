# NPC Trainers & Items

## NPC Trainers

NPC trainers make Cobblemon experience more interesting. Players must have VS Seeker in their inventories in order to spawn trainers around them. 

```
/summon cobblemontrainerbattle:trainer
/summon cobblemontrainerbattle:trainer{trainer:"trainer:radicalred/leader_brock",texture:"cobblemontrainerbattle:entity/trainer/slim/alola_leaf_piikapiika"}
```

## Trainer Tokens

NPC trainers drop Trainer Tokens when defeated in Pok√©mon battle. They do not drop the items when killed.
